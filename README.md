[![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v1-blue)](https://github.com/VirtuaChamp/ffxivlauncher/releases/tag/v1)

**Latest Release:** v1.01

**Release Date:** 19.01.2024


## Description

Hello! This launcher simplifies the process of playing Final Fantasy XIV on Steam with a non-Steam account. By replacing the original ffxivboot.exe, it ensures a seamless experience. The code automatically searches for the default installation of FF14 on drive C. If it's not found, the user is prompted to provide the path to the Square Enix\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn\boot folder. The launcher doesn't perform any additional actions beyond this.

Feel free to use the code not only for FFXIV but also for playing other games available on Steam with a non-Steam account.

## Usage

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/VirtuaChamp/FFXIV-NoSteam/releases/tag/ffxivlauncher).
2. Replace the original `ffxivboot.exe` on Steam with the one provided in the release.
